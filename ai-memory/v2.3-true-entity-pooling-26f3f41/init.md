# Initial Request

Implement v2.3 True Entity Pooling for the Hytopia Model Particles system

## Goals
- Implement true entity pooling to reuse particle entities
- Improve performance by avoiding entity creation/destruction
- Maintain physics system compatibility
- Preserve visual effects and behavior

## Background
Working on the v2.3-true-entity-pooling branch to implement a pooling system that reuses particle entities instead of constantly creating and destroying them.
