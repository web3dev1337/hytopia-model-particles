# payload-game

A simple implementation of a PvE style push the payload game.

In this game, the player can type `/start` to start. Spiders will begin spawning and the player must
click to shoot to kill the spiders while staying near the payload to keep it moving. 

Spiders continually spawn and increase in spawn rate as the player gets closers to the destination.
