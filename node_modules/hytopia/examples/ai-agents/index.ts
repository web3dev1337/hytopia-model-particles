/**
 * HYTOPIA SDK Boilerplate
 *
 * This is a simple boilerplate to get started on your project.
 * It implements the bare minimum to be able to run and connect
 * to your game server and run around as the basic player entity.
 *
 * From here you can begin to implement your own game logic
 * or do whatever you want!
 *
 * You can find documentation here: https://github.com/hytopiagg/sdk/blob/main/docs/server.md
 *
 * For more in-depth examples, check out the examples folder in the SDK, or you
 * can find it directly on GitHub: https://github.com/hytopiagg/sdk/tree/main/examples/payload-game
 *
 * You can officially report bugs or request features here: https://github.com/hytopiagg/sdk/issues
 *
 * To get help, have found a bug, or want to chat with
 * other HYTOPIA devs, join our Discord server:
 * https://discord.gg/DXCXJbHSJX

 * Official SDK Github repo: https://github.com/hytopiagg/sdk
 * Official SDK NPM Package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/hytopia

    You can plan long term actions but you can update your plans on the fly by taking actions in the world.

    Key locations in the map and their coordinates:

    If you call the speak tool, or another tool where you can also send a message at the same time, this is when you snap into character.
