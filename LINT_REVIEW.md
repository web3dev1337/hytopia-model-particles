# Code Review Checklist

This document outlines code quality issues that have been temporarily allowed in the ESLint configuration but should be reviewed when time permits.

## Console Statements

Many console statements exist throughout the codebase. These should be evaluated to determine if they should be:
- Replaced with a proper logging system
- Removed for production code
- Kept for debugging purposes

### Files with Console Statements

- `src/config/ParticleConfigLoader.ts`
- `src/core/ParticleEmitter.ts`
- `src/core/ParticlePool.ts`
- `src/lifecycle/ParticleLifecycleManager.ts`
- `src/patterns/ParticlePatternsRegistry.ts` (contains the majority of console statements)

## Any Types

The codebase contains several instances of the `any` type which may lead to type safety issues. Consider replacing these with more specific types.

### Files with `any` Types

- `src/core/ParticleEmitter.ts`
- `src/core/ParticlePool.ts`
- `src/patterns/base/basePattern.ts`
- `src/types.ts`

## Non-null Assertions

Non-null assertions (`!`) are used in several places. These bypass TypeScript's null checking and may lead to runtime errors. Consider using proper null checking or the nullish coalescing operator (`??`).

### Files with Non-null Assertions

- `src/lifecycle/ParticleEffectQueue.ts`

## ESLint Configuration

A more permissive ESLint configuration has been created to temporarily allow these patterns while development continues. The current relaxed rules are:

```json
{
  "no-console": "off",
  "@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any": "off",
  "@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion": "off"
}
```

When ready to address these issues, consider changing these rules back to `"warn"` or `"error"` and systematically fixing each issue.

## Fixed Issues

The following issues were fixed during the lint cleanup:

1. All unused variable warnings were addressed by:
   - Adding underscore prefixes to unused parameters
   - Removing an unused variable in `ParticleDataBuffer.ts`

2. Created an initial `.eslintrc.json` configuration file
